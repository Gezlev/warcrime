                <p>War crimes are serious violations of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and other serious violations of the laws and customs of war defined in Article 8 of the Rome Statute. They are one of the international crimes (crimes under general international law), which also include the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.</p>
                <p>War crimes can be divided into two types:</p>
                <p>a) grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, namely wilful killing, torture, causing suffering, deportation of the population, taking hostages, etc.;</p>
                <p>b) other serious violations of the laws and customs of war (deliberate attacks on the civilian population and objects, personnel and transport of humanitarian aid, killing and wounding belligerents who laid down their weapons, improper use of the enemy's flag, deliberate attacks on religious, cultural, historical sites, hospitals, a statement that there will be no mercy, looting cities, etc.) (Article 8 of the Statute of the International Criminal Court).</p>
                <p>Below are examples of common war crimes for understanding (the list is not exhaustive):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>injuries/deaths of civilians as a result of the use of weapons;</li>
                    <li>torture, physical violence, inhuman treatment or deprivation of liberty of civilians;</li>
                    <li>taking civilians hostage;</li>
                    <li>damage or destruction of civilian infrastructure that was not a military purpose;</li>
                    <li>deliberate strikes on personnel, vehicles or objects involved in the provision of humanitarian aid;</li>
                    <li>location and use of military equipment in residential areas, conducting military operations by the occupier in residential areas;</li>
                    <li>intentional damage/destruction of religious buildings (temples, mosques, synagogues, etc.), buildings of educational institutions, science, art, historical monuments that were not for military purposes;</li>
                    <li>violence against medical personnel, damage to medical vehicles, hospitals and medical equipment that were not a military objective;</li>
                    <li>use by the occupier of uniforms and insignia of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, distinctive emblems of humanitarian and medical institutions during military operations;</li>
                    <li>use of civilian infrastructure facilities and civilians to cover the Russian military;</li>
                    <li>deliberate actions aimed at creating obstacles to providing assistance to the civilian population.</li>

                <p>A war crime is not the same as a military crime.</p>
                <p><strong>Military crimes </strong> - international crimes, violations of international laws and customs of war. War crimes are listed in Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The types of war crimes are listed in the answer to question 1.</p>
                <p><strong>Військові злочини</strong> - (Article 401 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine) criminal offenses against the procedure for military service established by the legislation of Ukraine. Unlike war crimes, military crimes can be committed not only during war, but also in peacetime (for example, violation of statutory relations, and disobedience to superiors, destruction or damage to military property). However, it is worth noting that some military crimes defined by the Criminal Code coincide in their composition with war crimes defined by the Rome Statute, namely: looting, violence against the population in the area of military operations, mistreatment of prisoners of war, illegal use of symbols of the Red Cross, Red Crescent, Red Crystal and abuse of it. However, in general, the key difference is as follows: war crimes - violation of international laws and customs of warfare, military crimes - violation of the order of military service, regardless of the presence or absence of war.</p>

According to the Rome Statute, there is an exception when the following criteria coincide at the same time: a person was legally obliged to comply with an order; he did not know that the order was illegal; the order was not clearly illegal. At the same time, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are automatically explicitly illegal.</p>

However, the ICC has no jurisdiction over the crime of aggression committed by Russian officials (since the Russian Federation is not a party to the Rome Statute). Accordingly, in order to hold the leadership of the Russian federation accountable for the crime of aggression, an alternative means is to create a special tribunal, the charter of which would provide an opportunity to judge the leadership of the Russian Federation for the crime of aggression.</p>

However, it is important to remember that there are no statute of limitations for bringing to justice for international crimes, so criminals will not escape responsibility no matter how much time passes.</p>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>The special tribunal is a new separate body that can be specially created to administer justice in relation to international crimes committed by the Russian Federation during the armed conflict in Ukraine. Unlike the ICC, it will be created exclusively for such purposes and will operate until they are achieved. The Statute or other instrument that will govern the activities of this tribunal may regulate all aspects necessary for the effective administration of justice, while the ICC has significant limitations of jurisdiction. Thus, the ICC will not be able to investigate and consider the crime of aggression of the Russian Federation as a separate type of international crime, so this is one of the main reasons why it is necessary to create a tribunal.</p>
                <p>In addition, according to the Rome Statute, in particular, it is virtually impossible to judge the use of indiscriminate weapons and weapons that cause excessive damage and suffering, because the list of such weapons has not yet been agreed. The ICC may also not consider cases in absentia (without the presence of the accused). For establishing a special tribunal, all these shortcomings can be taken into account and overcome. A special tribunal can be either completely international (for example, the Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia or the Tribunal for Rwanda, which were formed by the UN Security Council), or hybrid, that is, formed under an agreement between Ukraine and an international organization, such as the UN or the EU, etc. (such as the special court for Sierra Leone, the special court for Kosovo, etc.). For Ukraine, the second option looks more realistic, since as long as the Russian Federation is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, it will block the creation of an international tribunal through the UN.</p>

                <p>Yes, they will. The fact that Ukraine is defending itself from the armed aggression of the Russian Federation does not release the Ukrainian military from responsibility if their actions contain elements of a war crime. For the relevant acts, the responsibility of Ukrainian military personnel is provided for by both the Rome Statute and the Criminal Code of Ukraine. As for the special tribunal, everything will depend on how the provisions of its Charter are written out, although according to the practice of the latter tribunals (courts), crimes are punished regardless of the party to an armed conflict.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, victims will be able to receive compensation based on the results of consideration by the ICC, a special tribunal (if established), and national courts of Ukraine against individuals. As for receiving compensation from Russia as a state directly, it can be reparations as a form of liability for violation of international law, consisting in payments by one state to another state, and not to the population of the state, although international law does not exclude the possibility of material compensation to the population directly.</p>
                <p>In any case, in the current circumstances, Russia has long refused to voluntarily fulfill its international obligations and it can only be forced to do so. Accordingly, at this stage, compensation is likely to be received in a different way, for example, Russian assets frozen abroad will be sent to Ukraine to compensate for the damage caused by the Russian Federation. In this case, the state will receive the money and pay compensation to people in accordance with domestic law.</p>
