    <h2>Annex 1</h2>
    <p>We may collect, store, and use the following categories of personal information about you:</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Information you provide</h4>
    <p>We may process the following information provided by you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>when registering and using the Software Product, including information that you provide by filling out forms in the SP, such as your name or nickname and email address (if submitted);</li>
        <li>when protecting or uploading content via SP, including any notes attached to images that you upload via the App or web interface; and</li>
        <li>when providing us with feedback or a request for additional services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that you are not required to provide an email address. If you want to directly link your identity to the content you send us, this will be very useful for any investigations that use your data. Please refer to Section 5 above to find out when personal information may be shared with third parties.</p>
    <p>You will not be able to access metadata about the content you capture through the App through the App itself; we knowingly delete this metadata to ensure that it cannot be inadvertently shared by you with anyone other than eyewitnesses, thereby posing a risk to their security. You'll be able to view images taken in the App's gallery to add notes, but you won't be able to change the content itself after it's uploaded via the App or web interface.</p>
    <p>When adding notes to any images you send, you should read the security instructions to make sure that your use of this tool does not violate the rights, interests, or safety of others that may appear in the materials.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Information from other sources</h4>
    <p>We may combine the information you provide with information from other sources, such as publicly available information obtained from the Internet and from human rights reports, to confirm it. However, we will not attempt to combine the information in such a way that users can be identified where they choose to remain anonymous.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Device information</h4>
    <p>We may collect and process information about the mobile phone or other device that you use to register or access the App, including the device brand, model, name, and product type.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Location and other confirmation information</h4>
    <p>When you use the App, we collect, process, and use information about the location of your mobile device. This information is embedded and encrypted as part of the metadata in the image or video you are shooting. This data is obtained from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>geolocation coordinates;</li>
        <li>identifiers of nearby mobile communication towers;</li>
        <li>Wi-Fi networks or Wi-Fi access points within range (where Wi-Fi is enabled);</li>
        <li>any Bluetooth addresses that are in the range (where Bluetooth is enabled); and</li>
        <li>the data received from the sensors in your device is related to your movement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is not combined with device IDs such as IMSI, and the user's IP-address is not collected.</p>
    <p>We only collect location information and other verification information from the moment you activate the camera on your device; collection is disabled after use. You can disable this feature at any time by disabling the location services settings for the App on your mobile device.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Aggregated data</h4>
    <p>To better understand and serve Software Product users, we collect summary statistics on service usage. This information does not identify users, and we may share these statistics by describing the App and service to other third parties.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Tracking technologies</h4>
    <p>To ensure confidential and secure operation, the software does not use cookies, web beacons, analytics tools, or unique device IDs or built-in applications.</p>
